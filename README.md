### Software Is People

I'm an Engineering Manager, because that's where I can do the most good, and because I find systems of humans more compelling than systems of software.

I believe everyone has a right to be who they are, but not the right to hurt everyone else. This turns out to be "political" in some contexts, but I didn't make it so, and I'm not going to back off the basic human right to exist and grow. I hope that's okay.

I try to keep my profile down to "Medium," but you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arbitrary/).
